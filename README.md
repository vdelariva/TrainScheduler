  * When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:
    * Train Name
    * Destination
    * First Train Time -- in military time
    * Frequency -- in minutes
  * App calculates when the next train will arrive; this is relative to the current time.
  * Users from many different machines must be able to view same train times.
