# TrainScheduler


**Description:**

The purpose of this assignment was to create a train schedule. The minimim capabilities include:
  * When adding trains, administrators are be able to submit the following:
    * Train Name
    * Destination
    * First Train Time -- in military time
    * Frequency -- in minutes
  * App calculates when the next train will arrive; this is relative to the current time.
  * Users from many different machines must be able to view same train times.
  
Additional features include a minute timer that updates the current time displayed and decrements the time to next time arrival. When the time to train arrival equal zero, the app recalculates the next train time and minutes to arrival.
